# MachineLearning

building mathematical models and making predictions using historical data or information
nowadays it's usually been used in  -  image recognition, speech recognition, email filtering, Facebook auto-tagging, recommender system

essentialy there are 3 types of machine learning - 
Supervised learning
Unsupervised learning
Reinforcement learning
 
1) Supervised learning 
which we provide sample labeled data to the machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the output.
has futher two types - Classification & Regression

2) Unsupervised Learning
The training is provided to the machine with the set of data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision.
it's type are Clustering & Association

3) Reinforcement Learning
a learning agent gets a reward for each right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action

Ploting a data via trained model using some python visualisation lib looks like this -
it helps us have a better understanding of data & give idea about any problem or model that should fit the best
here i have used iris inbuilt python dataset to do ploting
